# ðŸŽ® Hangman - Guess the Word Before Time Runs Out

## ðŸ“œ Description
Hangman is an engaging word-guessing game. The computer randomly selects a word, and you try to guess it one letter at a time. Each correct letter appears in its position within the word, while wrong guesses cost you a life. You have 6 lives to figure out the full word before the game ends. It's a mix of fun and challenge that sharpens your vocabulary skills.
